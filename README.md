# The Blind Maze - WWDC Scholarship Application [[Accepted]](https://github.com/wwdc/2020) 

This playground was created for [WWDC 2020 Scholarship Application](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/).

## Project
In The Blind Maze, the player will help Fulaninho to do one simple activity: get a fruit basket. However, there is a unique difficulty on this, the path is dark and you have only 30 seconds to memorize the labyrinth before the nightfall and guide Fulaninho in no more than 1 minute to his objective. I built this game to help people to train their memorization skills and exercise the brain in a little time.

This game was build using pure SpriteKit (and that's my very first project with it! üíª).

## How to play
Download the project and open the .playground file using Xcode. Then, press the play button on the last line of code! üëæ

Test your mind power and have fun! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
